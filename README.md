First run figure8a.m, figure8b.m to get the snapshots and seismic records
Then run Figure8Vx.m figure9Txx.m to plot the results used in the paper.

first run Figure11aStaggeredFDTra.m,figure11bStaggeredFD.m,figure11cKspace to get seismic records,
then run figure11compareSeimogramsVz.m, Figure11CompareSeis_recordVz.m; figure12compareSeimogramsTxx.m,figure12CompareSeis_recordTxx
to get the figures in figure 11 and figure 12.

First run figure5a.m, figure5b.m to get the snapshots and seismic records
Then run Figure5Vx.m figure6Txx.m to plot the results used in the paper.


First run figure8a.m, figure8b.m to get the snapshots and seismic records
Then run Figure8Vx.m figure9Txx.m to plot the results used in the paper.

fisrt run Figure11aStaggeredFDTra.m,figure11bStaggeredFD.m,figure11cKspace to get seismic records,
then run figure11compareSeimogramsVz.m, Figure11CompareSeis_recordVz.m; figure12compareSeimogramsTxx.m,figure12CompareSeis_recordTxx
to get the figures in figure 11 and figure 12.
This is only for the convinient of the reviwers.
